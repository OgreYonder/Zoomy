A dead simple program for doing pan &amp; zoom over an image. Use with a screen recorder to capture a video.

This was written to scratch an itch. I just wanted to make a 1080p pan/zoom over an image--nothing fancy.  But [Microsoft Photo Story](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11132) makes that way, way harder than it needs to be. All the alternatives cost money, so I wrote one.
